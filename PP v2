Requirement Document
 
 We want build a portal where user can buy and sell their product. With minimum number of inputs. We have only 1 single product to sell (but it may have different attributes to be able to search etc).
•  As of now we just need user and admin priviledges. (* in future)
•	There will be no payment gatways on site. (* but in future)
•	Direct links for buying/selling product
•	Each product should have link to add product to kart (1 click)

•	Browsing on complete site without login constraint. Login required only If placing order.
•	In case of first order without login then login requirement only after filling up the basic information
•	Smart search from database in text box field (similar to how search happens on google, except only from our existing database). If not available then add it database. (out admin would regularly need to clean up this database for repeats etc.)
•	Need database of user information, inventory bought and sold and inventory available in admin page.
